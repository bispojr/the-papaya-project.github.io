title: "Land and Labor Acknowledgement"
description: "We would like to acknowledge and extend gratitude and respect to all past, current, and future Indigenous stewards of the lands we, our institutions, and our technologies occupy. We also acknowledge and remember the enslaved and exploited peoples whose labor built the institutions and profits we, our institutions, and our countries of residence and origins benefit from. We honor their lives and deaths. We also acknowledge the continued exploitation of beings-- animals, humans, minerals, plants, soils, and waters, whose existence is extracted from to cater to our social, physical, and technological demands. We acknowledge and understand our own roles as beneficiaries of past and continued crimes against humanity, many of which continue and are named as systems of oppression.
