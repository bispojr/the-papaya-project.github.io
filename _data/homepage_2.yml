      We draw from the Philippines’ colonial history and assimilation to dominant 
      western ideologies. The Philippines is a southeast Asian country historically 
      colonized by many nations, in particular by Spain and the United States. 
      Some of the most significant impacts of these colonizations were on Filipino 
      culture, self-image, and way of living. Read more about the <a href="/about#symbolism">papaya symbolism</a>.

      Some of the key questions we tackle, particularly in computing and computing 
      education research, are about the ways that people have had to assimilate or 
      “whiten” themselves and their work into current dominant ideals and narratives-– 
      we are in an ongoing process of discussing and unpacking how we, and many 
      minoritized groups, have had to navigate systems that uphold white supremacy.

    We draw from the Philippines’ colonial history and assimilation to dominant 
    western ideologies. The Philippines is a southeast Asian country historically 
    colonized by many nations, in particular by Spain and the United States. Some of 
    the most significant impacts of these colonizations were on Filipino culture, 
    self-image, and way of living. These colonizations impacted Filipinos’ conceptions 
    of beauty, identity, worth, and even ability, and these have become embodied in 
    the western white form. From the periods of colonization until now, brown 
    Filipinos have been considered as “less than” by their lighter-skinned colonizers. 
    This colonial dynamic led to an obsession by Filipinos on the papaya, which has 
    been claimed to lighten or whiten the skin, building and enculturating the idea 
    among Filipinos that, if they were able to whiten their skin, then they would 
    be seen as equals, and so they would be deemed “acceptable” to society, their 
    workplaces, their families, and their other social structures. In other words, 
    the papaya has become a vehicle towards acceptance and white visibility. 
    From a bigger perspective, the papaya served to “whiten” the Filipinos’ history, 
    their identities, their self-image-– and it is this symbol of whitening that we draw from.
